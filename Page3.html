          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>You will hear a series of made-up Persian words, one at a time. These words do not exist in Persian.</p>
          <p>Your task is to rate each word how Persian-like it is: how much it sounds like a normal Persian word that you simply never learned before.</p>
          <p>There are no right or wrong answers. We want your honest opinion.</p>
        `,
        `
          <h2>What you will do</h2>
          <p>There is a mini test task that helps you learn how to do the task before you move to the main task.</p>
          <p>Focus on how the word sounds. Using the five labeled slider below, you will rate each word from <b>1</b> to <b>5</b>:</p>
          <p><b>5</b>: perfectly good, normal-sounding Persian word<br>
             <b>1</b>: awful or impossible-sounding Persian word</p>
          <p>After you’ve rated the word, press <b>Next</b> to continue.</p>
        `,
        `
          <h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
          <p>Focus on how Persian-like each word is, not whether it actually exists.</p>
          <p>We monitor responses to make sure you are attentive, so there will be simple attention checks along the way.</p>
